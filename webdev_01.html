            <p>
                I am a junior student at BRCC, pursuing a degree in entertainment technologies, specifically focusing on the film department. I am a huge fan of Dungeons and Dragons, as well as comic books -- in other words, I'm a nerd. I was born and raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and I went to Baton Rouge Magnet High School. During middle school I took a very basic computer science class, where we both improved our typing speeds and used Code Monkey to learn the basics of coding. It was super barebones and I remember very little the the coding skills from those years. I hope to learn more within this semester.
